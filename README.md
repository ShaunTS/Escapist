# Escapist
[Meteor.js]

Javascript Prototype utilizing several Google geo-location apis.

App providing you with a list of reactive escape routes from your current location to general types of locations nearby, such as public places like libraries, chain restaurants, coffee shops, or simply a place where one can sitdown and open a laptop.

Key word 'prototype', in its current stage I am pretty much just familiarizing myself with the half dozen or so rest apis I'll be using.
